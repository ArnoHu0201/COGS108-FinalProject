    "We predict that weapons are more likely to be used in felony crimes, in areas with high crime rate, and against physically weaker people(excluding 18-60 years old males). We are predicting in this way because first, felony crimes are serious and violent and commonly the criminals need weapon in order to commit such crimes, and by similar reason crimes happening in areas with high crime rate have larger chance of happening more violent crimes. Second, since the dataset includes Strong Arm(HANDS, FIST, FEET OR BODILY FORCE) as a weapon and very likely the most common weapon, we predict physically weaker victims adds chance of weapon use since strong arm are likely used by physically stronger criminals.

    "Ethics and privacy are critical considerations in the data science projects. As our project focused on the criminal activity in LA, there are many ethical concerns that can potentially involve in the project analysis. Ethics concerns consider the whole data science process involve the bias in data, data collected and used, and post analysis. For example, when analyzing the criminal activity data, it is extremely important to consider the potential biases in the data that could potentially impact the results. For example, certain neighborhoods or demographics may be overrepresented or underrepresented, that could skew the results of the data and make the data analysis results become biased. It is therefore important to account for these biases and ensure that the accurate analysis is as equitable as possible. In the dataset website we find, the dataset is expected to reflect the incidents of crime in the City of LA dating back to 2010. This data is transcribed from original crime reports and there may be inaccuracies within the data due to the inaccuracies within the original crime reports. Also, according to the website, some location fields with missing data are noted, this could cause the potential bias.\n", 
    "The privacy concerns involved in the data for criminal activity data may include sensitive personal information, such as victim names or addresses, which could potentially be used to identify the individuals. It is therefore extremely important to ensure that any personal identifying information is protected and that the data is used in a manner that respects an individual's privacy. The potential for harm is that analyzing the criminal activity data could potentially lead to harm or discrimination against certain populations or neighborhoods. It is therefore important to be mindful of these potential impacts and ensure that the analysis is conducted in an ethical and equitable manner. With respect to the policy implications, the results of the analysis could have important policy implications, such as decisions regarding police use of the force or resource allocation. It is important to ensure that these policy decisions are made in an ethical and equitable manner, by taking into account the potential impacts on the different populations. \n",
    "In order to address these concerns, we need to carefully review the crime data from the website and identify any potential biases or privacy concerns. We also need to take steps to ensure that the analysis is conducted in an ethical and equitable manner, such as accounting for any biases in the data, and being mindful of the potential impacts on the different populations to be transparent about the methods and findings."
